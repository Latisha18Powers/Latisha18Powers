## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend developer focused on building secure, efficient, and scalable GraphQL APIs using Apollo Server. This space is dedicated to sharing my work, experiments, and learnings as I explore best practices in modern API development and backend architecture.

My current focus is on creating well-structured GraphQL schemas, implementing robust authorization and authentication flows, and optimizing API performance for real-world applications. With Apollo Server as the backbone, I aim to build APIs that are both developer-friendly and production-readyâ€”offering precise data fetching, strong type safety, and clean integration with modern services and databases.

Security is a top priority in my work. I pay close attention to common attack vectors like query depth abuse, introspection exposure, and improper access control. In this repository, youâ€™ll find examples of how I implement techniques such as query validation, role-based access control, and custom directives to enforce security policies across the API layer.

I also explore patterns for data fetching, error handling, and schema modularization, as well as how to connect GraphQL APIs with REST services, SQL/NoSQL databases, and cloud infrastructure. These projects are a mix of practice, learning, and real-world implementation ideas designed to evolve over time.

If you're working with GraphQL, interested in Apollo Server, or just exploring backend development in general, feel free to dive into the code, raise issues, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, discussion, and collaboration.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find something useful or inspiring here as we build better, more secure APIs for the web together.
